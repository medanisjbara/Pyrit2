# Pyrit2
An attempt to port Pyrit to python3

This projects starts at the initial commitment of the original [Pyrit](https://github.com/JPaulMora/Pyrit) and tries to add changes accordingly until (hopefully) it reaches the same level of functionality of the original Pyrit while being up to date with the currently used python3 version.

At the moment. The inital commit itself isn't fully working. This project isn't going to replace the original pyrit any time soon. And the Pyrit developer might start working on the python3 version (therefore there's no need for this project)
